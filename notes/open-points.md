## JSON to form

Make it easy to edit the config. Maybe make use of [jsonform](https://github.com/joshfire/jsonform).

## OrientDB

CDE makes use of [OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/) - is there any chance to use it for this project as well?

DB files are stored in `pentaho-solutions/system/.orient`.
