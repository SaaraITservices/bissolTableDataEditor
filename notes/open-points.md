# Open points

## Table pagination

Open source project: http://www.datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap.html

dataTables file are already included in CDF, so there is no need to reference them.

Implemented.
Missing functionality:
On clicking new record remove 'New Record' button and table.
Add small table to input the data with a save button.
Once saved:
1) Show success msg 
2) Display 'New record' button and whole table again.

## JSON to form

Make it easy to edit the config. Maybe make use of [jsonform](https://github.com/joshfire/jsonform).

## OrientDB

CDE makes use of [OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/) - is there any chance to use it for this project as well?

DB files are stored in `pentaho-solutions/system/.orient`.
